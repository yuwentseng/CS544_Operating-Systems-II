1. What is the purpose of having an individual handler function for each exception/interrupt? (i.e., if all exceptions/interrupts were delivered to the same handler, what feature that exists in the current implementation could not be provided?)

ANSWER:

This is to distinguish between different exception/interrupt types. TRAPHANDLER pushes the interrupt vector trapno and the error code errno in the stack, and handles it according to the exception/interrupt type later.

2. Did you have to do anything to make the user/softint program behave correctly? The grade script expects it to produce a general protection fault (trap 13), but softint’s code says int $14. Why should this produce interrupt vector 13? What happens if the kernel actually allows softint’s int $14 instruction to invoke the kernel’s page fault handler (which is interrupt vector 14)?

ANSWER:

The reason for this is that the current Page fault handler has a call permission of 0 and can only be called by the system, so we call the user environment softint directly to generate a General Protection fault permission error.
